Note: Without indicating any optional arguments you will not be alerted if your website is down. You must specify at least one phone number to text, or email address to send an email to. 

# How does it work?

Pysite Monitor will first request your web page and return the HTTP return code, or the type of connection error it gets when requesting your URL. Then if there is an issue (HTTP code other than 200) Pysite Monitor will log into your email account (currently gmail and yahoo are supported) and send an email alert to an address you specify or send you a sms / text alert when your website is down.

To use the SMS Alert feature you must specify your service provider, currently Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T are supported.
